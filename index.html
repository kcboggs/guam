            Guam is a challenging place to summarize in just a few words.
            It’s so much more than its miles upon miles of sandy beaches, waterfalls, coconut trees, and coral reef ready for you to explore. Our unparalleled sunsets, starry night skies, and rolling mountains and valleys help paint a picture of what you’ll find here but don’t go nearly far enough.  Experience a thrilling adventure on land or at sea.
            Unravel 4,000 years of intriguing history — ranging from pre-colonial culture and archaeological sites and the site where Magellan’s ships landed, to Spanish forts and WWII battle sites — Guam has many stories to tell.
            But this is not an island stuck in the past. Our culture and history live on with a cosmopolitan twist, as seen through our eclectic cuisine, great places to stay, fun and unique festivals, and vibrant art, music, and fashion scenes rooted in pride of place and heritage. Our people’s eyes are fixed on the horizon while their feet are firmly planted in their native soil.
